### Slow Feature Analysis

Repository created to collect my work for the project "Slow Feature Analysis", as a part of the Fundamentals of Computer Science for Neuroengineering course at TUM.

#### What is SFA?

SFA (Slow Feature Analysis) is an unsupervised learning algorithm for extracting slowly varying features from a quickly varying input signal. In Computational Neuroscience, SFA can be applied to attempt an understanding of how the brain learns to form meaningful representations of its environment (whose appearance changes mostly in a continuous way over time) from statistical regularities in the sensory input (for example, the responses of individual retinal receptors that vary on a faster scale). 

#### About the project

This project aims at the implementation of the SFA algorithm in Python. Firstly, I will focus on linear SFA transformations on a 2-dimensional time-dependent signal. Secondly, I will use linear SFA on a high-dimentional correlated signal, simulating a slowly moving input to the receptive of a hypothetical visual cell.
